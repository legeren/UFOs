## Overview of Project: 
In this module's deliverable, I am tasked with adding additional filters for city, state, country and shape in the page created for the module's work.  The table needs to be filterable using one or multiple criterias.

## Results: 
These are the easy steps someone might use to filter the data using different criterias:
1. Go to the page and scroll down to the filter boxes and data table.  Follow the format provided to key in different filter criteria.

2. Enter a filtering criteria in one or many of the available boxes: Enter Date, Enter City, Enter State, Enter Country or Enter Shape.  

a. In the below example, "circle" was keyed in the **Enter Shape** box.

b. In the below example, "mason" was keyed in the **Enter City** box ***AND*** "circle" was keyed in the **Enter Shape** box.

3. To clear the filtering, simply erase all the inputted values from the filter search boxes:

## Summary: 
One drawback of this current design is that the user is that the user entry needs to be in the same case and the date keyed in the exact format as the example provided as the search is not "dynamic" and able to intuit from user input that "Benton" is equal to "benton" or "01/10/2010" is equal to "1/10/2010".

A couple of recommendations to further improve this development would be:
1. Add a way to sort the results in ascending or descending order; and
2. Add a button to clear the filters so the user does not need to go back and erase all the filters
